You have created and embedded your charts, so let's build and deploy the web application to see that everything worked.

1. In the Realm UI in your browser, select "Hosting" on the left-hand side under "MANAGE"<BR>
<img src="/assets/images/Hosting.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="70%"><BR><BR>
1. You should see this page:
<img src="/assets/images/HostingWithFiles.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><BR><BR>

1. Follow the <A HREF="/web/2020/06/09/Build-Web-App.html">build instructions starting at #5</a> to build and deploy the application.

1. Paste the URL from the hosting page into your browser and login with your App admin username and App admin password.

1. Watch as your new embedded charts load! Or, <A HREF="/charts/2020/06/14/TroubleshootingCharts.html">troubleshoot problems with Charts</A>.

If your charts loaded, you are all set!
