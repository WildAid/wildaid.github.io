You have created and embedded a chart, so let's build and deploy the web application to see that everything worked.

{% include build_web.md %}

{% include login_web.md %}

Test to make sure the chart you embedded actually works. If it is not working, there is a section on <A HREF="/charts/2020/06/14/TroubleshootingCharts.html">Troubleshooting Charts</a>.

Create more charts in the next guide!
