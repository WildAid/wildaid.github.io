<img src="/assets/images/Hosting.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="70%"><BR><BR>
1. You should see this page:
<img src="/assets/images/HostingWithFiles.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><BR><BR>


1. move/delete existing code

1. Follow the <A HREF="../09/Build-Web-App.html">build instructions starting at #5</a> to build and deploy the application.
