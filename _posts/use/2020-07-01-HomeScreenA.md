# The Home Screen
On the home screen, there are a few sections. The top section includes a search bar to "Find Records" and an avatar (the avatar is circled in blue). Then there is a map, and a button to board the vessel:<BR>

The blue dot on the map indicates your location. Also shown is your latitude and longitude in degrees, minutes and seconds. Use 2 fingers to pinch or spread to zoom in or out.

# Your Information
Select your avatar to see your name and email address:<BR>

# Logging Out
Select your avatar to get your name and more information. You can log out by selecting your avatar, and then selecting "Log Out":<BR>

To cancel logging out and go back to the home screen, tap outside of the user information box (greyed out areas). 

# Marking Time At Sea
Select your avatar to get your name and more information. The solid red circle on your avatar indicates you are not currently at sea:<BR>

If you select the "On Duty" toggle, the toggle slides showing it is active, and the circle's color will change to green, indicating that you are at sea:<BR>

# Boarding a Vessel/Pre-Boarding Search
When boarding a vessel, it saves time if the app can use information from a previous record. When you select the "Find Records" bar or the "Board Vessel" button, you will see a page that shows the 5 most recent vessels boarded:<BR>
<img src="/assets/images/use/SearchScreenBoardA.png" alt="Access your unique user data with the five most recent vessels populated in a list for you, or search to find a new vessel." width="50%" style="border:1px solid black"><BR><BR>

You can select any of the records shown, or type the first part of the vessel name to search to find matching records. In this example, we have typed "pred" and can see a vessel called "Predator":<BR>
