Giving feedback with O-FISH from the TestFlight app is easy. There are two-ways: [in the app itself](#inapp) - better when submitting a screenshot - and [through TestFlight](#testflight) - better when just writing text. You may only submit one screenshot at a time using either method, but you can submit feedback as often as you want.<BR><BR>

In TestFlight, select the O-FISH app - do NOT select the "OPEN" button to open the app. Select within the green box indicated:<BR>

Then select "Send Beta Feedback" as indicated by the green box:<BR>

You will be prompted to include a screenshot from your Camera Roll or not. We recommend sending screen shots via the [in app method](#inapp) as it is faster. If you choose "Include Screenshot" you will be prompted to choose an image from your camera roll and then taken to a screen to type in your feedback. If you choose "Don't Include Screenshot" you go directly to the page to type in your feedback.<BR><BR>
On the feedback screen, type your feedback in the white box and select "Submit" in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will send the feedback immediately.

You may send as much feedback as you like - the more the better!<BR><BR>

<A NAME="inapp"></a>**Submit Feedback While In the App**<BR><BR>
You can give in-app feedback by taking a screenshot of the app, and select the screenshot when it appears in the lower-left hand corner:<BR>

Now you can draw and make marks to highlight specific areas. In this example, the feedback is the text is too small so the user circled and pointed to it:<BR>

Select "Done" in the upper left hand corner. You will then see a dialog asking what to do with the photo. Select "Share Beta Feedback..."<BR>

Type your feedback in the box and click "Submit" in the upper-right corner when done. This will send the feedback immediately, and save the marked-up photo to your device. <BR>
