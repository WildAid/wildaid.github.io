Now it's time to put your Realm app into Development mode so deploying the web app is easier, and set up a fulltext index with Atlas Search:

1. In the Realm UI, enable Realm Sync "Development Mode" - Click Sync on left-hand menu, then “Development Mode” tab.  
        <img alt="How to enable Development Mode in Realm UI" src="/assets/images/Sync_Dev_Mode.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><BR><BR>
1. Fill in the appropriate information - Select the cluster name with RealmSync modifier, the database is "wildaid", the partition key is "agency" and if prompted the field type is "string". Click "Turn Dev Mode On":
        <img alt="How to Turn the Dev Mode ON" src="/assets/images/Dev_Mode_On.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><BR><BR>

1. Click "OK" that Development Mode is on. <BR><BR>
1. Despite other indications, development mode is not really on until you click "Review and Deploy" in the blue bar on the top, and then deploy the changes:

Onwards!
