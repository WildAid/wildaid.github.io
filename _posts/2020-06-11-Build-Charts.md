There are 6 charts to make for the O-FISH web app. There are 4 charts in the Compliance Rate section on the homepage - each of the numbers for "Compliance Rate", "Boardings" and "Violations" are their own charts, plus the donut chart:

Underneath the Compliance Rate section, there is a map of boardings, and then a chart with a list of boardings:
<img src="/assets/images/BoardingsMap.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><BR><BR>
<img src="/assets/images/ListOfBoardings.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><BR><BR>

First, we will set up the Data Sources and create a dashboard for our charts.
