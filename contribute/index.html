<CODE>git clone https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web<BR>
cd o-fish-web<BR>
git checkout -b to_fix_issue_12345</CODE><BR><BR>

Code your fix and <A HREF="/build">build the O-FISH application</A> to test that it works.<BR><BR>

Once you verify the issue is fixed, you will need to submit your patch to the github code. Commit, and push, e.g.:<BR><BR>

<CODE>git commit -m 'fixing issue 12345'<BR>
git push origin fix_issue_12345</CODE><BR><BR>

Create a pull request as the output instructs:<BR><BR>
