    If you want to contribute to the O-FISH application, find an issue to solve:<br>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-android/issues">Android mobile app issues</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-ios/issues">iOS mobile app issues</a></li>

        </ol>
</p>
In addition to labels that are self-explanatory - bug, enhancement, good first issue, hacktoberfest - there are some issue labels that need explanation:
<UL><LI><em>needs own instance</em> - These issues require the developer to <A HREF="/build">build their own instance of the infrastructure.</a> They are issues that involve needing 'super powers' or infrastructure changes, such as changes involving a global administrator or changes to indexes or Realm functions. Building an instance is free, but does take some time to go through the <A HREF="/build">detailed instructions</A>.</LI>
<LI><em>days: x</em> - This is an estimate of how much developer time this issue will need. 0.25 means about 2 hours, 0.5 means 4 hours, 1 day is 8 hours, etc.</LI>
</UL>
To work on an issue:
<UL>
<LI><UL><LI>Please only work on one issue at a time. We will not be assigning more than one issue, to ensure that everyone that wants to participate, can.</LI>
<LI>Add a comment to the issue you want to work on, stating "I would like to work on this issue".</LI>
<LI>If there are no other requests to work on the issue, and you are not assigned on any other issue, you may start work right away, even if it has not been assigned to you.</LI>
<LI>Please do NOT work on an issue that is assigned to someone else.</LI>
<LI>Please do NOT work on more than one issue at a time.</LI>
<LI>Please do NOT work on an issue that has another comment stating "I would like to work on this issue."</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Failure to follow these guidelines or <A HREF="https://www.mongodb.com/community-code-of-conduct">MongoDB's Community Code of Conduct</A> may result in an invalid PR.</LI>

<p>
    You will need to fork the appropriate code repository by going to the appropriate github page (<a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-android">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-ios">iOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web">Web</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-realm">Realm</a>) and selecting "Fork" in the upper-right corner:<BR>
<img src="/assets/images/ForkCode.png" style="border:1px solid black" ><BR><BR>


You then need to get the code from your new fork. Select the green "Code" button and select the copy icon to copy the code location:<BR>
<img src="/assets/images/GetCode.png" style="border:1px solid black" ><BR><BR>

In a terminal window, paste the github link after 'git clone', e.g.:<BR>
<code>
git clone https://github.com/my-github-name/o-fish-web.git<BR>
cd o-fish-web
</code>
<p>
    Track changes from the original repo:
</p>
<code>
git remote add --track main upstream https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web.git<BR><BR>
git fetch upstream
</code>
<p>
    Create and switch to a new branch on your fork:
</p>
<code>
git checkout -b fix_issue_12345 upstream/main
</code>
<p>
Code your fix and build the O-FISH application (<A HREF="/android/2020/06/11/Build-Android.html">Android</A>, <A HREF="/ios/2020/06/11/Build-iOS.html">iOS</A>, <A HREF="/web/2020/06/09/Build-Web-App.html">web</A>) to test that it works. You may want to test against the <A HREF='sandbox.html'>sandbox</a> or <A HREF='/build'>build your own foundation</A>.
</p>
<p>
    Once you verify the issue is fixed, you will need to submit your edits to your fork's branch, commit, and push. Make sure your commit message includes which issue(s) will be fixed. For example:
</p>
<code>
git add .<BR><BR>
git commit -m 'Adding a widget to fix issues #12345 and #100'<BR><BR>
git push -u origin fix_issue_12345
</code>
<p>
The output of `git push` has instructions on how to create a pull request:
</p>
<code>
remote: Create a pull request for 'fix_issue_12345' on GitHub by visiting:<BR>
remote:      https://github.com/my-github-name/o-fish-web/pull/new/fix_issue_12345
</code>
<p>
Create a pull request by visiting the github URL from your output to the `git push` command.
<p>
    Within 3 business days, a developer will review your code, and once the code is ready it will be merged in.
