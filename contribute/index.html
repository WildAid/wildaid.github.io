    You will need to fork the appropriate code repository by going to the appropriate github page (<a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-android">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-ios">iOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web">Web</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-realm">Realm</a>) and selecting "Fork" in the upper-right corner:<BR>
<img src="/assets/images/ForkCode.png" style="border:1px solid black" ><BR><BR>


You then need to get the code from your new fork. Select the green "Code" button and select the copy icon to copy the code location:<BR>
<img src="/assets/images/GetCode.png" style="border:1px solid black" ><BR><BR>

In a terminal window, paste the github link after 'git clone', e.g.:<BR>
<code>
git clone https://github.com/my-github-name/o-fish-web.git<BR>
cd o-fish-web
</code>
<p>
    Track changes from the original repo:
</p>
<code>
git remote add --track main upstream https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web.git<BR><BR>
git fetch upstream
</code>
<p>
    Create and switch to a new branch on your fork:
</p>
<code>
git checkout -b fix_issue_12345 upstream/main
</code>
<p>
    Code your fix and <a href="/build">build the O-FISH application</a> to test that it works.
</p>
<p>
    Once you verify the issue is fixed, you will need to submit your edits to your fork's branch, commit, and push. Make sure your commit message includes which issue(s) will be fixed. For example:
</p>
<code>
git add .<BR><BR>
git commit -m 'Adding a widget to fix issues #12345 and #100'<BR><BR>
git push -u origin fix_issue_12345
</code>
<p>
Create a pull request by following the instructions and using the URL given in the output from the previous command:
</p>
<code>
remote: Create a pull request for 'fix_issue_12345' on GitHub by visiting:<BR>
remote:      https://github.com/my-github-name/o-fish-web/pull/new/fix_issue_12345
</code>
<p>
    Within 3 busines days, a developer will review your code, and once the code is ready it will be merged in.
